	<h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
	<p class="paragraph">
		"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed
		some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
		step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only
		say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
		not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
		assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
		my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
		fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
		development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
		developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
