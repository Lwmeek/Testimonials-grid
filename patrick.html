    <h2>
        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
        Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
        easy.
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
        really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence neccessary to be
        able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
        developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
        attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
        people."
